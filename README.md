# SP500-Prediction
This project aims to identify the macro-economic factors which best explain variability in the SP500 index. 
Initially, 22 macro-economic variables covering 5-years of monthly data were considered, out of which 15 variables were selected after initial EDA, hypothesis testing and variable selection procedures. These variables were fit into various models, out of which the PCA model with 10 predictor variables explained around 83% of the variability in the model.
